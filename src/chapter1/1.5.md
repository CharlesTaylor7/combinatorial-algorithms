 f1 is O(g1(n)) which means 0 < f1(n) < c1 * g1(n) for all n > n1
 f2 is O(g2(n)) which means 0 < f2(n) < c2 * g2(n) for all n > n2

let f(n) = f1(n) * f2(n)

multiply the inequalities to get:
0 < f(n) < c1 * g1(n) * c2 * g2(n)

0 < f(n) < (c1 * c2) * (g1(n) * g2(n))

which holds whenever n > n1 & n > n2, that is n > max(n1, n2);

so, in conclusion:
f(n) = f1(n) * f2(n)
c' = c1 * c2,
n' = max(n1, n2)

qed. f(n) is O(g1(n) * O(g2(n)))
