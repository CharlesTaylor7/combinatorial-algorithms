 f1 is O(g(n)) which means 0 < f1(n) < c1 * g(n) for all n > n1
 f2 is O(g(n)) which means 0 < f2(n) < c2 * g(n) for all n > n2

let f(n) = f1(n) + f2(n)

 add the inequalities to get:
 0 < f < c1 * g(n) + c2 * g(n)

0 < f(n) < (c1 + c2) * g (n)


which holds whenever n > n1 & n > n2, that is n > max(n1, n2);

so, in conclusion:
f(n) = f1(n) + f2(n)
c' = c1 + c2,
n' = max(n1, n2)

qed. f(n) is O(g(n))
